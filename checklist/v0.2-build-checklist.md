##Planning & Versioning

[x]Complete v0.1 insecure baseline
[x]Close v0.1 documentation
[]Create versions/v0.2-build.md
[]Define scope of v0.2 (stability + control, not full security)
[]Confirm naming and documentation conventions

##Base System Stability

[x]Linux OS installed and booting cleanly
[x]Hostname set and documented
[x]System time, timezone verified
[x]Reboot tested successfully
[]Confirm no failed systemd units
[]Verify disk health and mounts are stable

##Network Configuration

[x]Static or stable DHCP IP confirmed
[x]Network interface identified and documented
[x]Internet connectivity verified
[x]DNS resolution verified
[]Document network layout (LAN, gateway, DNS)
[]Confirm no unintended listening interfaces

##Firewall (Controlled, Not Hardened)

[x]UFW installed
[x]UFW enabled
[x]Explicit allow rules for required services only
[x]SSH (22) allowed
[x]HTTP (80) allowed
[x]Mining / daemon ports documented
[]Remove unused firewall rules
[]Document firewall rule purpose in v0.2 notes

##Services

SSH
[x]SSH service running
[x]Password authentication enabled (still allowed in v0.2)
[]Confirm SSH only listening where intended
[]Document SSH config location and defaults

##Web Server (Apache)

[x]Apache installed
[x]Apache running on boot
[x]Web server reachable from LAN
[x]Default configuration still in place
[]Document Apache config paths
[]Confirm no unintended virtual hosts

##Storage

[x]Identify all disks (lsblk, fdisk -l)
[x]Verify which disks are in use vs empty
[]Define purpose of each disk (OS, data, future)
[]Decide filesystem types
[]Plan mount points (do not implement yet)
[]Document storage plan in v0.2

##Logging (Baseline → Structured)

[x]Confirm local logs exist
[x]Verify rsyslog active
[x]Verify journald active
[]Identify key log files (auth, syslog, apache)
[]Document log locations
[]No remote logging yet (v0.3+)

##Validation & Evidence

[x]Capture service status outputs
[x]Capture firewall status output
[x]Capture open ports (ss -tulpn)
[x]Capture Apache reachability (curl)
[]Verify evidence files are readable and dated
[]Confirm evidence matches documentation

##Repository Hygiene
[
x]README updated
[x]Versions directory in use
[x]Evidence directory in use
[]Clean up outdated notes
[]Ensure no sensitive real credentials committed
[]Confirm file naming consistency

#Documentation
[x]v0.1 marked complete
[]Write versions/v0.2-build.md
[]Summarize what changed from v0.1 → v0.2
[]List known remaining weaknesses
[]Commit v0.2 documentation
